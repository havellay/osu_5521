# CSE 3521 - Programming Assignment 01 (Part1)
#
# Input - one text file containing a single integer in each line and several
#  such lines; this text files is expected to contain the ranks of the ojects
#  coming down the Conveyer Belt in this environment. The assumption is that the 
#  file is well formatted. Occurrence of two '-1' ranks in this text file
#  will denote that we have reached the end of the belt
#
# Output - a sequence of text printed to stdout that explains the values input
#  to this agent, the state of the agent and the action taken by the agent

#
# Execution - this program requires the 'sys' and 'string' python modules
#   execution syntax :
#	'python part2.py [Belt_file]'
#   if the input file 'Belt_file' is not specified by the user, then the
#   default file "inp" that is provided with this code is used as input.
#   An alternate method of providing custom input to the program would be 
#   to edit the contents of the file "inp".
#
# For the last element in the belt, this agent always decides to PICKUP the item;
# This is so that this program behaves in the same way as the example shown in
# the Question
