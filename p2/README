# This code shows the different methods to transport robots across a cliff
# given the limitations of battery power.
# A limitation of the program is that it doesn't explicitly always tell the
# cost of the complete transportation activity - However, the number should
# be easily apparent from the output.
#
# for A* search, the heuristic employed is that each robot travels at the 
# speed of the fastest robot in the bunch which is A
#
# the program should be executable through stdlinux
#
# to provide different output, the function FindTrueCost() would have to be
# modified and different input would have to be supplied from the main()
# method.
#
# This code is as though the robots are on the left side of the chasm and the
# base station is on the right side of the chasm; all naming will follow this

        # C -> 5 min
        # D -> 10 min
